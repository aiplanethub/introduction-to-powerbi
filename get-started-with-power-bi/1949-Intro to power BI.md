Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, interactive insights. Whether your data is in a workbook or in a collection of cloud-based and on-premises data warehouses, Power BI lets data analysts connect to their data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share their findings.

Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on any device, with native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Android.
