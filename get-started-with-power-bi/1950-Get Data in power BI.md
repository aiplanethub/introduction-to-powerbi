Before you can create reports, you must first extract data from the various data sources.

1. Get data from files

A flat file is a type of file that has only one data table and every row of data is in the same structure. The file does not contain hierarchies. You may be familiar with the most common types of flat files:

- Comma-separated values (.csv) files
- Delimited text (.txt) files
- Fixed-width files
- Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx)


In Power BI, on the Home tab, select Get data. In the list that displays, select the option that you require, such as Text/CSV or XML. For this example, you will select Excel.

**NOTE:** The Home tab contains quick access data source options, such as Excel, next to the Get data button.
