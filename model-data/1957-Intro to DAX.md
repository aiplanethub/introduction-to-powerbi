Data Analysis Expressionsâ€¯(DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values. You can use DAX to solve a number of calculations and data analysis problems, which can help you create new information from data that is already in your model.

### Use calculated columns

DAX allows you to augment the data that you bring in from different data sources by creating a calculated column that didn't originally exist in the data source. This feature should be used sparingly, which will be explained later in this module.

For example, assume that you are importing data from a database that contains sales transactions. Each individual sales transaction has the following columns: Order ID, Product ID, Quantity, and Unit Price. Notice that a column doesn't exist for the total sales amount for each order.

The following figure shows how the initial shape of the data appears in a Power BI table visual.
