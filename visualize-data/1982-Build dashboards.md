Microsoft Power BI dashboards are different than Power BI reports. **Dashboards** allow report consumers to create a single artifact of directed data personalized just for them. **Dashboards** can be comprised of pinned visuals taken from different reports.

You create reports over your data model using the tables, columns and visualization tools. You can't create a dashboard this way. Once you have a report, you can pin individual visualizations from a report into a dashboard. Dashboards can have multiple tiles from different reports and different data models. When they click on a tile, the report opens.

Before you can create a dashboard, you need to publish your report. When you're finished designing your report, you can publish it to your workspace in Power BI Service. You can also export it to Microsoft Excel.

### Publish reports

When you publish a report, Power BI Desktop packages your report and data, including all your visualizations, queries, and custom measures, and then it uploads them to Power BI Service.

To publish your report, select the **Publish** button on the **Home** tab.

You might be prompted to save your changes, in which case, you select **Save**, and then proceed to save your Power BI (**.pbix**) file.

When building dashboards, you should ensure that the same theme applies to all of your dashboards to create a cohesive picture. You could also apply a specific theme to reports and dashboards so that all report elements or tiles are uniform. This consideration is particularly important when you're building multiple dashboards. Power BI has the functionality to apply a theme directly to all visuals of a report.

### Themes in Power BI

A variety of themes are available for use in the Power BI service. Go to a dashboard, select the **edit dropdown arrow**, and then select **Dashboard** theme.

So you can customize your report to cater specifically to your needs.
