Power BI visuals are attractive charts and graphics that you can use to revitalize your data. 

**Visuals** allow you to share data insights more effectively and increase comprehension, retention, and appeal. Visuals are a fundamental part of your report because they help your report audience connect and interact with the information to make informed decisions quickly.

Power BI comes with many out-of-the-box Power BI visuals. These visuals are available in the visualization pane of both *Power BI Desktop* and *Power BI Service*, and can be used for creating and editing Power BI content. The full library of available visualizations can be found in the **[Microsoft Appstore](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-GB/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals)**, where there are over 300 visual types to choose from.

In Power BI Desktop, each visual is represented by an icon in the **Visualizations pane**. The types of visuals that are available include *charts*, *maps*, *cards*, a *table*, a *matrix*, and many more. You will learn how to select the correct visual later in this module.

### Area Charts
 
Area Charts in Power BI are also known as **layered area charts**. The area between the line and axis is shaded with color to indicate volume. 

### Line Charts

Line charts are one of the most-used and recognized charts to display data. The data points are connected by a straight line with each of the points in the line corresponding to a data value. **Line charts are best used to measure trends over a period of time.**

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are a popular choice because they are simple to create and easy to interpret. Bar charts are useful when there is a need to display data that includes negative values as it is possible to position the bars below as well as above the x-axis.

### Pie Charts

The purpose of a Pie chart is to illustrate the contribution of different values to a total and are good for displaying data for around 10 categories or fewer.

### Scatter Charts

Scatter charts use dots to demonstrate the relationship between two different variables.

### Bubble Charts

A bubble graph is used to visualize data set with three dimensions. It is quite similar to the Scatter chart, however, the scatter chart has two value axes – **one numerical data long horizontal axis** and **one along the vertical axis**, showing the relationship between the two numerical values.

### KPIs

Using the KPI visualization allows you to track real-time progress made towards a measurable goal. You can quickly analyze if you are ahead or behind on achieving a goal and measure the distance or time needed to achieve it.

KPIs work best in a series, for instance, showing the daily, monthly, and yearly goals in the section of a Power BI report.
